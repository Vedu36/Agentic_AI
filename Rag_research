The ArXiv query "RAG latest papers" retrieved 688,423 results. The first result is a paper titled "Auto-RAG: Autonomous Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models". The paper introduces Auto-RAG, a model that autonomously retrieves and refines knowledge using iterative retrieval, leveraging the decision-making capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to gather valuable external information. Here is a concise summary of the batch of data extracted from ArXiv:

The batch appears to describe two related papers on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for Large Language Models (LLMs).

Paper 1: "Auto-RAG" is an autonomous system that synthesizes reasoning-based decision-making instructions for iterative retrieval and fine-tuning of LLMs. It achieves outstanding performance across six benchmarks, can adjust the number of iterations based on question difficulty and retrieved knowledge utility, and provides an interpretable and intuitive experience.

Paper 2: "Modular RAG" transforms RAG systems into reconfigurable frameworks, enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in knowledge-intensive tasks. (The summary is incomplete, but it seems to focus on improving RAG systems.)

Both papers appear to focus on advancing the capabilities of LLMs through innovative RAG systems. Here is a concise summary of the batch of data:

The paper discusses the limitations of the traditional "retrieve-then-generate" paradigm in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and proposes a modular RAG framework that decomposes complex systems into independent modules and operators. This modular approach allows for a more reconfigurable and advanced design, integrating routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. The paper also identifies common RAG patterns and provides a comprehensive analysis of their implementation nuances. The authors suggest that this modular framework will enable the development of new operators and paradigms, paving the way for the continued evolution and practical deployment of RAG technologies. The paper surveys the recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RA-LLMs), which combine the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the power of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide up-to-date and reliable external knowledge. The survey covers three primary technical perspectives: architectures, training strategies, and applications. It reviews existing research studies, highlighting the challenges and capabilities of RA-LLMs, and discusses current limitations and promising directions for future research. Batch 5/12 consists of two ArXiv entries. 

The first entry appears to be a survey paper on "RAG Meets LLMs" (RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, LLMs: Long-Context Language Models) with a link to the survey and a comment mentioning that this is the long version of a paper accepted by KDD2024. The categories for this entry are Computer Science, Computation and Language, Artificial Intelligence, and Information Retrieval.

The second entry is a research paper titled "In Defense of RAG in the Era of Long-Context Language Models". It discusses the role of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in context-based answer generation, arguing that despite the emergence of long-context LLMs, RAG is still a reliable solution. It disagrees with recent studies that favor long-context LLMs over RAG in long-context applications. The two papers in this batch focus on improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for large language models (LLMs). The first paper proposes an Order-Preserve RAG (OP-RAG) mechanism that enhances answer quality in long-context question-answer applications by retrieving relevant information in a specific order. The authors find that OP-RAG can achieve higher answer quality with fewer tokens than traditional LLMs.

The second paper, MultiHop-RAG, benchmarks RAG for multi-hop queries that require retrieving and reasoning over multiple pieces of information. The authors find that existing RAG systems are inadequate for these types of queries and propose improvements to mitigate this limitation. Here is a concise summary of the extracted ArXiv batch:

The authors, Yixuan Tang and Yi Yang, created a novel dataset called MultiHop-RAG, which focuses on multi-hop queries in Reasoning-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This dataset includes a knowledge base, multi-hop queries, ground-truth answers, and supporting evidence. The authors demonstrate the dataset's utility through two experiments, showing that existing RAG methods struggle with multi-hop queries. The dataset and an implemented RAG system are publicly available on GitHub. This paper compares Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing lengthy contexts. The study finds that while LLMs like Gemini-1.5 and GPT-4 can understand long contexts directly, RAG is more computationally efficient. The authors propose a hybrid approach called Self-Route, which selectively uses RAG or LLMs based on model self-reflection, achieving a balance between performance and computational cost. The research provides guidelines for long-context applications of LLMs using RAG and LLMs. Here is a concise summary of the extracted data:

The paper "LLM4VV: Developing LLM-Driven Testsuite for Compiler Validation" explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate tests for validating compiler implementations of the OpenACC parallel programming paradigm. The authors fine-tuned various open-source and closed-source LLMs, including Meta Codellama, Deepseek Coder, and OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo, and evaluated their performance using different prompt engineering techniques. The results show that the LLM Deepseek-Coder-33b-Instruct produced the most passing tests, followed by GPT-4-Turbo. The paper contributes to the field by exploring the capabilities of LLMs for code generation, investigating fine-tuning and prompt methods, and analyzing the outcome of generated tests.
